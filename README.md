This is my personal readme file for my Github page. I am currently a full-Stack Developer learning Blockchain. My focus is on Web3 and Dapp's currently. Check out some of my recent projects in my repositories. I'm an aspiring student in Developer Relations, hoping to make a difference in the cryptocurrency space. I am an excellent communicator both written & verbal, I'm flexible, and also I ask questions whenever I don't understand something. I am always trying to logically figure out how things work. Thanks for stopping by!
